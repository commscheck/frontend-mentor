## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) – UI framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) – Strong type system for JavaScript
- [vanilla-extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/) – Strongly-typed CSS-in-JS
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) – Static site generation

### What I learned

Coming from iOS development, web has **a lot** of different ways to achieve the same outcome.
Especially with CSS I tried a lot of different libraries and techniques
before I settled on an approach I liked
(I ended up picking [vanilla-extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/)).

Margin collapse was quite confusing when I wasn't aware of it.

### Continued development

I'm certain there's multiple ways I could've achieved the same layout via CSS.
I'm keen to know if there's simpler or more intuitive approaches I can use.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks: A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) – I always end up referring back to this page when doing flex layouts.
